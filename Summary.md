**I.	INTRODUCTION**

Mobile Payment defines a money payment made for a product or service through a portable electronic device, such as a mobile phone or tablet. It began to become popular in 2016 when HKMA issued stored value facilities (SVP) licenses to companies [1], including Alipay Financial Service Limited, HKT Payment Limited, Octopus Card Limited, etc. Mobile payments bring a huge advantage to customers and merchants, which provides more payment methods and leads customers to more convenience to pay. The emergence of the internet has increased the trend of mobile payment, the pandemic has also boosted the usage of mobile payment. The Visa Consumer Report has shown a large increase in the growth of online shopping frequency and expenses because of social distancing and lockdown, showing environmental factors and social factors also increase the usage of mobile payment.

**II.	DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/IMPLEMENTATION**

The Fast Pay mobile payment app mainly uses QR codes to make payments. Quick Response Code (QR) is commonly used in payment systems as a quick and convenient way to transfer money between individuals and businesses. There are three modes of payment using a QR code.
A.	User-Presented Mode Payment
The user presents their own QR code from the application, the merchant will scan the QR code and request payment order, and the application will show the payment result back to customers [3].
B.	Order Code Payment
The merchant creates a QR code with the order details for customers to scan as part of the payment requirement. The customer can check the order information after scanning the code before confirming payment [4].
C.	Entry Code Payment
Users are required to scan the  merchant’s QR code and redirect to a third-party page, which requires users to enter the payment amount and password to confirm the payment, the third-party page will show the payment result after payment is confirmed [5].
D.	Touchscreen Graphic User Interface
The Fast Pay mobile payment application will implement a touchscreen graphic user interface, which is operated by fingertips or a stylus to select icons and perform tasks instead of using a mouse pointer or trackpad. The Graphic User Interfaces use different icons and menu bars to replace memorizing complex command lists, users can simply click on the icons to see different functions.
E.	Implementation and Database
Two databases will be created to store the user’s basic information, which is inputted on the signup page, and a database for each transaction that users make. In the user profile database, name, Gmail, phone number, and payment password will be stored. Password will be encrypted using the HA-256 hashing method and stored in the database.
